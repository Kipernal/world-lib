world-lib
=========

Library for interfacing with Super Mario World ROMs and Lunar Magic's hacks.

The purpose of this library is to provide a generic method for grabbing data from SMW ROMs in a way that makes it easy to create an application that works alongside Lunar Magic.

Includes functions mostly related to level data, for example, getting a level's complete palette, regardless of whether or not its palette is overridden.

Also included are graphics decompression routines for the two standard methods SMW uses to compress graphics.
